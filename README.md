# Shoepeg; Experimental Evolution Study

The experimental population used in this study is the Shoepeg maize landrace, a southern US dent corn. Cycle zero of our experimental evolution study was planted in the summer of 2016 in four 1/10-hectare plots in two different locations (Rollins and Genetics Farm) in Columbia, MO. A Total of 384 plants (96 in each plot) were randomly selected for genotyping and phenotyping. Leaf tissues were collected from individual selected plants for DNA extraction and were measured for Plant height (PH). Approximately 400,000 markers were genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol. To develop Cycle 1, the shortest or tallest plants in each plot of cycle 0 was identified. Progeny from these plants were grown in summer of 2017 and the process is being repeated indefinitely.
